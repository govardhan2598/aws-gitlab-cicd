# Creation administrator AMI with AWS management console

On this page we will create AMI account associated to our AWS account with administrator permissions. It is highly suggested to use AMI instead of the root account. Also, AMI is mandatory if you want to manage AWS resources using `aws cli`.

- Go to [Groups IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/groups);

- `Create New Group`:

  - Group Name - `admins`;

  - Attach Policy:

    - Find and attach `AdministratorAccess` policy;
