# 1. Preparations

## 1.1 Administrator IAM creation

Before we begin, we need programmatic access to our AWS account, to create and manage resources with `awc cli`. In order to achive this, we need to create administrator IAM user using AWS management console.

- Go to [Users IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/users);

- `Add user`:

  - User name - `admin`;

  - Access type:

    - Check `Programmatic access`;

  - Set Permissions - `Attach existing policies directly`:

  	- Select `AdministratorAccess`;

  - `Tags`;

  - `Review`;

  - `Create user`;

  - Download `.csv` file (filename will be `creadentials.csv`).

<br><br>

## 1.2 SSH Key Pair creation

Also, we will need SSH access to configure our future EC2 instances. It is good practice to create separated key pair for any group if EC2 instances you launch. But for this time we only need one.

- Go to [Keys Pairs management console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?#KeyPairs);

- `Create key pair`:

  - Name - `ec2`;

  - File format - If you are using Linux or Mac chose `pem`. If windows - `ppk`;

<br>

After key pair will be created the download process will begin. Make sure to store it in a safe place, `~/.ssh/` for example. In addition, if you are using Linux, you have to apply permission to this file:

```
$ sudo shmod 600 ~/.ssh/ec2.pem
```

<br><br>

## 1.3 AWS CLI configuration

To gain access to our AWS account, we need to configure `awc cli` to use our `admin` IAM user. This can be done by running following command and pass content of the `creadentials.csv` to it:

```
$ aws configure
```

> As well as `access key ID` and `secret access key` we will need to specify a region, where are we going to create AWS Resources. We could use resources from different regions, but you have to know that interregion communications charged additionally.

<br>

More information about `aws cli` configuration you could find in the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html).

<br><br>

## 1.4 ECR Repository creation

In order to test ECR availability of our future EC2 instances, we need to create a repository and store a docker image there in advance. I suggest to use `nginx:alpine` image, because we can use it to test public request processing with our instances out of the box. Let's start with repository creation:

```
$ aws ecr describe-repositories

{
    "repositories": []
}

$ aws ecr create-repository --repository-name nginx

{
    "repository": {
        "repositoryArn": "arn:aws:ecr:eu-central-1:678005261235:repository/nginx",
        "registryId": "678005261235",
        "repositoryName": "nginx",
        "repositoryUri": "678005261235.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/nginx",
        "createdAt": "2020-04-09T11:38:29+03:00",
        "imageTagMutability": "MUTABLE",
        "imageScanningConfiguration": {
            "scanOnPush": false
        }
    }
}
```

We will need to use specify `repositoryUri` and ECR url in a following step, so let's save those as variables:
```
$ ECR=678005261235.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com
$ REPOSITORY=678005261235.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/nginx
```

<br>

Now, we will register our Docker daemon, in order to push image to ECR repository. This can be achived with the next command:

```
$ aws ecr get-login-password | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin $ECR

WARNING! Your password will be stored unencrypted in /home/psyke/.docker/config.json.
Configure a credential helper to remove this warning. See
https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/#credentials-store

Login Succeeded
```

<br>

Next we will push the `nginx:alpine` image to the ECR repository:

```
$ docker pull nginx:alpine \
  && docker tag nginx:alpine $REPOSITORY:alpine \
  && docker push $REPOSITORY:alpine

alpine: Pulling from library/nginx
Digest: sha256:abe5ce652eb78d9c793df34453fddde12bb4d93d9fbf2c363d0992726e4d2cad
Status: Image is up to date for nginx:alpine
docker.io/library/nginx:alpine
The push refers to repository [678005261235.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/nginx]
6f23cf4d16de: Pushed 
531743b7098c: Pushed 
alpine: digest: sha256:ef2b6cd6fdfc6d0502b77710b27f7928a5e29ab5cfae398824e5dcfbbb7a75e2 size: 739
```

To test that image is pushed successfully, let's do:

```
$ aws ecr describe-images --repository-name nginx

{
    "imageDetails": [
        {
            "registryId": "678005261235",
            "repositoryName": "nginx",
            "imageDigest": "sha256:ef2b6cd6fdfc6d0502b77710b27f7928a5e29ab5cfae398824e5dcfbbb7a75e2",
            "imageTags": [
                "alpine"
            ],
            "imageSizeInBytes": 8492473,
            "imagePushedAt": "2020-04-09T11:47:56+03:00"
        }
    ]
}
```

Also, you could find your new image in [ECR management console > repositories](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories) *(Don't forget to choose the right region)*:
